    "Agents & Tools: The fundamental building blocks for defining capabilities and reasoning. Clear instructions and docstrings are paramount.\n",
    "Runners & Session Services: The engine and memory management system that orchestrate agent execution and maintain conversational context.\n",
    "Delegation: Designing multi-agent teams allows for specialization, modularity, and better management of complex tasks. Agent description is key for auto-flow.\n",
    "Session State (ToolContext, output_key): Essential for creating context-aware, personalized, and multi-turn conversational agents.\n",
    "Callbacks (before_model, before_tool): Powerful hooks for implementing safety, validation, policy enforcement, and dynamic modifications before critical operations (LLM calls or tool execution).\n",
    "Flexibility (LiteLlm): ADK empowers you to choose the best LLM for the job, balancing performance, cost, and features."
